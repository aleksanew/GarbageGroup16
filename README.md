# Small-Modular Garbage Sorter

Welcome to the **Small-Modular Garbage Sorter** repository! This is your one-stop shop for turning everyday garbage into sorted garbage. Tired of garbage piling up? We've got the garbage solution for you. Garbage in, garbage out‚Äîbut sorted garbage, that is! If you're into garbage detection (and who isn't?), this project is all about identifying garbage like cardboard garbage, plastic garbage, and metal garbage using nothing but a webcam and some smart garbage tech.

## What is This Garbage?

This garbage project is a machine vision-based garbage sorter designed to detect and classify garbage materials in real-time. It grabs video from your webcam, processes the garbage frames, and uses pre-trained models to spot cardboard garbage, plastic garbage, and metal garbage. It's modular, so you can tweak the garbage components without creating more garbage code. Perfect for small-scale garbage management, like in your home or office, where garbage accumulates faster than you can say "garbage day"!

Why "Small-Modular Garbage Sorter"? Because it's small (fits on a Raspberry Pi full of garbage), modular (swap out garbage parts easily), and sorter (sorts your garbage, duh). And yes, the name is dumb on purpose‚Äîgarbage humor at its finest!

## Garbage Features

- **Real-Time Garbage Detection**: Streams garbage video from a webcam and detects garbage objects instantly.
- **Material Garbage Classification**: Uses AI models to classify garbage into cardboard garbage, plastic garbage, or metal garbage with >85% accuracy (on non-garbage days).
- **Modular Garbage Design**: Plug-and-play garbage modules for easy upgrades‚Äîadd more garbage sensors or garbage actuators without rewriting the whole garbage codebase.
- **Low-Cost Garbage Hardware**: Built with affordable garbage like a $20 webcam, $35 Raspberry Pi, and $10 servos. Total garbage budget: Under $100!
- **Garbage Integration**: Works with OpenCV for garbage video processing and TensorFlow/PyTorch for garbage model inference.
- **Fun Garbage Element**: Overuse of the word "garbage" in this README, because garbage puns are the best kind of garbage.

## Garbage Installation

To get this garbage running on your machine:

1. Clone the garbage repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/small-modular-garbage-sorter.git
   cd small-modular-garbage-sorter
   ```

2. Install garbage dependencies (Python 3.x required):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Includes OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and other garbage libs
   ```

3. Download pre-trained garbage models:
   - Grab the TrashNet garbage dataset models from [Stanford TrashNet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).
   - Or use Hugging Face garbage models like ahmzakif/TrashNet-Classification for instant garbage classification.

4. Set up your garbage hardware:
   - Plug in a webcam (any USB garbage will do).
   - Optional: Connect a Raspberry Pi with servo motors for physical garbage sorting.

If you encounter garbage errors, make sure your Python environment isn't full of garbage‚Äîuse a virtualenv!

## Garbage Usage

Run the garbage sorter like this:

```
python main_garbage_sorter.py
```

- Point your webcam at some garbage (e.g., a crumpled cardboard box, plastic bottle, or metal can).
- Watch as the system detects and labels the garbage in real-time.
- For demo mode: `python demo_garbage.py --live` to show off your garbage skills.

Pro Tip: Test with actual garbage for best results. Simulated garbage (like drawings) might confuse the garbage models.

## Garbage Contributing

Want to add more garbage to this project? Fork the repo, make your garbage changes, and submit a pull request. We're open to garbage ideas like:
- Adding support for more garbage types (e.g., glass garbage or organic garbage).
- Improving garbage accuracy with better preprocessing.
- Garbage documentation enhancements‚Äîbecause who doesn't love more garbage words?

Follow the garbage code of conduct: Keep it clean, even if the topic is garbage.
